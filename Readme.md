# DESeq2 Analysis using miRNA data from TCGA

<p>Â This repository includes a comprehensive codebase that explains how to obtain and filter TCGA data as well as how to use DESeq2 to analyse differential expression. The data was obtained via PRAD-TCGA, and the TCGABiolink package was used to download and manipulate the data. An "Enhanced Volcano" library was used to obtain the volcano plot.</p>
